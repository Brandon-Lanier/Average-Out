# Average Out

## A cryptocurrency portfolio tracker and strategic exit application for selling across multiple assets.

## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

Average out is an all-in-one cryptocurrency portfolio tracker and strategic exit application that allows users to calculate different selling scenarios across multiple assets.  

With the massive rise in popularity of cryptocurrency, the world has become saturated with a countless number of exchanges, platforms and applications that allow people to get involved in the crypto scene.  What these platforms all lack is the ability to help an investor exit their positions in a strategic way.

Average Out was built with the seller in mind.  

Looking to hit a target return selling across multiple assets?  Let us handle the calculations and tell you EXACTLY how much to sell of each asset based on live market data.  

Want to extend your sale over a set duration and not try to time the market?  Average out can handle running your active exit strategies for whatever duration you choose.

Please note that Average Out is a work in progress and features are being added all the time!  If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me in the contact section at the bottom of the readme.
